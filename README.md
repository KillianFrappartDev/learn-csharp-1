Exercises from Mosh Hamedani's course (https://codewithmosh.com)

Ex 01
=> The program should ask for a number between 1 and 10 and tell if the user's input is valid.

Ex 02
=> The program should accept two numbers and display the biggest in the console.

Ex 03
=> The program should accept width and height of an image and tell if it is landscape or portait.

Ex 04
=> Your job is to write a program for a speed camera. For simplicity, ignore the details such as camera, sensors, etc and focus purely on the logic. Write a program that asks the user to enter the speed limit. Once set, the program asks for the speed of a car. If the user enters a value less than the speed limit, program should display Ok on the console. If the value is above the speed limit, the program should calculate the number of demerit points. For every 5km/hr above the speed limit, 1 demerit points should be incurred and displayed on the console. If the number of demerit points is above 12, the program should display License Suspended
